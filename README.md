# dynamic-script
### A demo project which loads dynamic initialization data via a script tag in
### the static index.html file before any javascript has initialized.

/api/user.js returns a dummy script after a 1 second delay, mimicking
a slow call to an external api server.

To setup and start the server run:
  npm install
  bower install
  npm start
